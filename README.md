# AaronLuckettFinalProject
This is my final project to conclude the training program by Edgewards. The program is a set of tests that will be run on a demo E-Commerce website. 
These tests include applying a coupon to a basket full of items, checking the deductions are correct and also checking the order numbers given to the 
customer are the same. The tests can be run in Chrome and Firefox, depending on what is in the run settings file (not inlcuded in the git repository). 
The run settings file also contains personal details such as login credentials. The tests can be run in the command line, and the specflow living doc 
plugin produces a html report on the tests that displays the results in a visually pleasing way. A snapshot of this can be seen below.
